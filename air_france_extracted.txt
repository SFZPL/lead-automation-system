“Before we dive in, I’d love to understand—what challenge or opportunity made you feel this is the right time to explore working with a partner like us?”
“Often airlines face challenges balancing global brand consistency with regional adaptation. Is that something you’re experiencing, or is it something different driving this?”

(Objective: create mutual understanding of where they are today)
3. Cause Analysis
🎙️ Dig deeper with empathy:

(Objective: co-identify root causes without making them defensive)
4. Negative Impact

“What does a smooth process look like for you in terms of timelines, reviews, and sign-offs?”
